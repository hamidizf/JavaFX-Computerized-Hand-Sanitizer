JavaFX-Computerized-Hand-Sanitizer

INTRODUCTION:

The goal of this project to create a sanitizer dispenser that works both automatically (depending on data gathered from obstacle avoidance sensor) and manually. It also includes a TFT LCD on which the steps of hand sanitizing will be displayed. 

CONTEXT:

The outbreak of COVID-19 has emphasized the significance of personal hygiene, and the need for an efficient hand sanitization. This project aims to design an automated hand sanitizer dispenser with a TFT LCD display, which guides users through the process of proper hand sanitization, as it is an essential action in protecting against COVID-19.

COMPONENTS LIST:

• Two Arduino Uno boards
• A Servo motor
• An obstacle avoidance sensor
• A TFT LCD
• Jumper wires(male to female)
• A soap container
